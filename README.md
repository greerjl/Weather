# Weather
 * Inspo comes frome here: https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/1dzbu7/project_whats_the_weather/
 * Project Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13jmAC7XmhtMPkgzPgm03NO0W2quhtHjayUgYV9AH9Vw/edit?usp=sharing
 ** GOALS
  * Create a program that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap.org that prints out information about the current weather, such as       the high, the low, and the amount of rain for wherever you live. 
  * Use multiple of OpenWeatherMap APIs for added functionality 
  * Print out data for the next 5-7 days so you have a 5 day/week long forecast.
  * Print the data to another file that you can open up and view at, instead of viewing the information in the command line.
  * Write a file that you can print information to so that your project is more interesting. 
 ** USE 
  * Potentially could be used on Raspberry Pi to display weather information
